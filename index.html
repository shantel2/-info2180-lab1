 <h2>Shantel Wellington</h2>

 <p>Hello, my name is Shantel Wellington and I currently attend The University of the West Indies where i am pursing a Bachelor's of science degree in Computer Science. I grew up in the parish of St. Ann. It is my intention to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science after graduation to hone my Artificial Intelligence and Cryptography skills. It is also a dream of mine to make a difference in society, whether on a global or national scale. Knowing that the applications I have created have aided or improved someone's life will bring me happiness. I see myself assisting people with their day-to-day operations through software implementation, owing to my knowledge of various programming aspects and my eagerness to learn new things, all while ensuring that my life is ultimately about something even greater than myself. </p>
